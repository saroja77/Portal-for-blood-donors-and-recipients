# Portal-for-blood-donors-and-recipients

The Blood Bank portal is designed to serve as a common ground which connects the blood donors and the users who require blood. This displays the blood requests, collects the data of the donors available and those who are willing to donate, checks the availability of blood type city wise and blood type wise and other important details that a donor and a patient needs to know.
